Question 1:
Explain the different types of linked lists (Singly Linked List, Doubly Linked List).

Singly linked list:
    Each node contains data and pointer/ reference to the next node in the sequence.
    advantages: Simple to implement, efficient for insertion and deletion at the beginning of the list.
    disadvantages: Inefficient for searching and accesing elements as it requires 

Doubly Linked list:
    Each node contains data, reference to next node and previous node
    advantages: Allows traversal in both directions and easier to delete the node using one reference
    disadvantages: uses more memory for storing additional reference and complex to implement.

Question 2:
Analyze the time complexity of each operation.

    Add: O(n) - it requires to traverse to the end of the list in worst case.
    Search: O(n) - it requires traversal from head to target node
    Traverse: O(n) - each node is visited once.
    Delete: O(n) - require to traverse to find the target node.

Question 3:
Discuss the advantages of linked lists over arrays for dynamic data.

    Dynamic size: Linked list can grow and shrink dynamically, unlike array which has fixed size.
    Efficient insertion/deletion: insertion/ deletion can be done in the constant time if the position of node is known 
                                  without need of shifting the nodes.
    Memory utilization: Memory is allocated dynamically unlike array in which it is pre-allocated. So linked
                        list avoids wastage of memory.
