Question 1:
Explain why data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories.

Data structures and algorithms are crucial for managing large inventories because
    1. Performance: Optimized data structures ensure faster access, insertion, deletion and updatation of data which is vital for real-time inventory management
    2. Memory management: Utilize the memory efficiently and reduce overloading
    3. data Integrity: Ensures consistency and correctioness of data
    4. Scalability: data structures with proper algorithms can handle large volumes of data without any adverse degradation of performance

Question 2:
Discuss the types of data structures suitable for this problem.

HashMap is suitable for this problem because inventory management system requires fast searching, insertion and deletion operations
which are provided in O(1) complexity

Question 3:
Analyze the time complexity of each operation (add, update, delete) in your chosen data structure.
    The complexity of add is O(1) which is constant time, update operation provides complexity of O(1) which
    involves accessing of keys and updating which is also done in constant time.
    The complexity of deletion is O(1). 

Question 4:
Discuss how you can optimize these operations.

this operations can be optimized by following means:
    1. Concurrency handling: For multi-threaded environments, the usage of 'ConcurrentHashMap' avoids bottleneck by managing concurrency
    2. batch operations:  Implement batch operations for adding, updating, or deleting multiple products to reduce the overhead of multiple method calls.
    3. load factor management: Ensure the load factor of the HashMap is managed to avoid excessive rehashing, which can degrade performance.
