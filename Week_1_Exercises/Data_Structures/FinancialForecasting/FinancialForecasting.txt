Question 1:
Explain the concept of recursion and how it can simplify certain problems.

    Concept of Recursion:
        Recursion is a method where solutions of the problem depends on solutions to subproblems. It is a function which called itself to solve the problem of smaller instance.
        Base case: 
            Condition on which recursion stops. It prevents infinite recursion and on which function completes.
        Recursive case:
            Here function calls itself with modified to break the problem into smaller subproblems.

    Recursion simplifies the problems by dividing complex problems into smaller subproblems which are easier to solve.
    recursion code is readable and more intuitive.
    Reduces the code by avoiding explicit usage of loops.

Question 2:
Discuss the time complexity of your recursive algorithm.

    Time complexity of recursive algorithm is O(n) because function makes a recursive call for each period.

Question 3:
Explain how to optimize the recursive solution to avoid excessive computation.
    Recursion can be optimized by using memoization that is storing the result of sub problem which is already solved and reduce unnecessary recursion.
