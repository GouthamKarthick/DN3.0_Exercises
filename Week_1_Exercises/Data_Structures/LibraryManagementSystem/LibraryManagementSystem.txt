Question 1:
Explain linear search and binary search algorithms.

Linear Search:
    An algorithm that traverses the list from beginning to end until the target is found or list ends.

    Time complexity:
        Best: O(1) - element at the beginning
        Average and Worst: O(n)

Binary Search:
    It utilizes divide and conquer which requires the list to be sorted.
    It starts by comparing the target with middle element and continues the search in first half or second half.

    Time complexity:
        Best: O(1) - element is at the middle
        Worst and Average: O(log n)

Question 2:
Compare the time complexity of linear and binary search.

    Linear Search:
        Best: O(1) - element is at the beginning
        Average: O(n)
        Worst: O(n) - element is at the end or not present
    
    Binary Search:
        Best: O(1) - element is at the middle
        Average: O(log n)
        Worst: O(log n) - element is not present

Questionc 3:
Discuss when to use each algorithm based on the data set size and order.

    Linear search is used when list is unsorted, list is small or elements requires one-time searches only.
    Binary search is used when list is sorted, list is large, elements required frequent searches.
